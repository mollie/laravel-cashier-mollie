# Installation

First, make sure to add the Mollie key to your `.env` file. You can obtain an API key from the [Mollie dashboard](https://www.mollie.com/dashboard/developers/api-keys):

```dotenv
MOLLIE_KEY="test_xxxxxxxxxxx"
```

Now pull the package in using composer:

```bash
composer require mollie/laravel-cashier-mollie "^2.0"
```

## Setup

Once you have pulled in the package:

1. Run `php artisan cashier:install`.

2. Add these fields to your billable model's migration (typically the default "create_users_table" migration):

    ```php
    $table->string('mollie_customer_id')->nullable();
    $table->string('mollie_mandate_id')->nullable();
    $table->decimal('tax_percentage', 6, 4)->default(0); // optional
    $table->dateTime('trial_ends_at')->nullable(); // optional
    $table->text('extra_billing_information')->nullable(); // optional
    ```

3. Run the migrations: `php artisan migrate`

4. Prepare the configuration files:

    - configure at least one subscription plan in `config/cashier_plans.php`.

    - in `config/cashier_coupons.php` you can manage your subscription coupons. By default an example coupon is enabled. Consider
      disabling it before deploying to production.

    - the base configuration is in `config/cashier.php`. Be careful while modifying this, in most cases you will not need
      to.

5. Prepare the billable model (typically the default Laravel User model):

    - Add the `Laravel\Cashier\Billable` trait.

    - Optionally, override the method `mollieCustomerFields()` to configure what billable model fields are stored while creating the Mollie Customer.
      Out of the box the `mollieCustomerFields()` method uses the default Laravel User model fields:

    ```php
    public function mollieCustomerFields() {
        return [
            'email' => $this->email,
            'name' => $this->name,
        ];
    }
    ```
   Learn more about storing data on the Mollie Customer [here](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/customers-api/create-customer#parameters).

    - Implement the `Laravel\Cashier\Order\Contracts\ProvidesInvoiceInformation` interface on your billable model. For example:

    ```php
        /**
        * Get the receiver information for the invoice.
        * Typically includes the name and some sort of (E-mail/physical) address.
        *
        * @return array An array of strings
        */
        public function getInvoiceInformation()
        {
            return [$this->name, $this->email];
        }

        /**
        * Get additional information to be displayed on the invoice. Typically a note provided by the customer.
        *
        * @return string|null
        */
        public function getExtraBillingInformation()
        {
            return null;
        }
    ```

6. Schedule a periodic command to execute the `CashierRun` command. When processing lots of orders, consider increasing the job frequency to prevent hitting Mollie's rate limiter.

    ```php
    use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schedule;
    use Laravel\Cashier\Console\Commands\CashierRun;

    Schedule::command(CashierRun::class)
        ->hourly() // run as often as you like (daily, monthly, every minute, ...)
        ->withoutOverlapping(); // make sure to include this
    ```

ðŸŽ‰ You're now good to go :).
